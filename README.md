<h3>What is Zero Trust and Defense in Depth?</h3>
<hr>
<h4><span>Zero Trust</span></h4>
<p><span><strong>Zero Trust</strong> is a security framework that operates under the principle of "never trust, always verify." It challenges the traditional notion of trusting everything inside an organization's network and instead adopts a more granular approach to access control.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Letâ€™s review the Zero Trust core principles and practices:</span></p>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Never trust, always verify:</strong><span> Adopt a mindset of distrust and verify the identity and access of users, devices, and applications, regardless of their location or network context.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Strict access controls:</strong><span> Implement fine-grained access controls based on the principle of least privilege, ensuring that users only have access to the resources they specifically need.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Multifactor authentication (MFA):</strong><span> Enforce the use of MFA to add an extra layer of security by requiring multiple factors, such as passwords, biometrics, or tokens, for user authentication.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Continuous monitoring:</strong><span> Employ real-time monitoring and analysis of network traffic, user behavior, and system logs to detect and respond to potential threats promptly.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Microsegmentation:</strong><span> Divide the network into smaller segments and apply access controls between them, limiting lateral movement and containing potential breaches.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Data encryption:</strong><span> Protect sensitive data with strong encryption mechanisms, both in transit and at rest, to prevent unauthorized access or data leakage.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>With Zero Trust, every user, device, and application is treated as untrusted until verified, regardless of their location or network context. By implementing strict access controls, multi-factor authentication, and continuous monitoring, organizations can significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and mitigate the impact of potential breaches.</span></p>
<hr>
<h4><span>Defense-in-Depth Strategy</span></h4>
<p><span>In conjunction with Zero Trust, the <strong>Defense-in-Depth strategy</strong> provides an additional layer of protection by employing multiple security mechanisms at various layers of the organization's infrastructure. This approach recognizes that relying on a single security measure is insufficient to combat sophisticated cyber threats.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Defense-in-Depth emphasizes the use of diverse security controls such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, encryption, and regular security audits. Defense-in-Depth uses the following approach to implement these security measures:</span></p>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Layered security approach:</strong><span> Implement multiple layers of security controls at different levels, such as network, application, and data, to create a comprehensive defense strategy.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Perimeter security:</strong><span> Establish strong perimeter defenses like firewalls and intrusion detection systems to protect against external threats and unauthorized access attempts.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS):</strong><span> Utilize IPS to detect and prevent network attacks, such as intrusion attempts, malware infections, and data exfiltration.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Regular security audits:</strong><span> Conduct periodic assessments and audits to identify vulnerabilities, gaps in security controls, and areas for improvement.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Employee awareness and training:</strong><span> Educate employees about security best practices, potential threats, and their role in maintaining a secure environment.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Incident response planning:</strong><span> Develop a well-defined incident response plan to quickly identify, contain, and mitigate security incidents, minimizing the impact of potential breaches.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>These core principles form the foundation of Zero Trust and Defense in Depth strategies, enabling organizations to enhance their security posture, protect critical assets, and effectively mitigate cyber threats. By layering these measures, organizations establish a robust defense posture that enhances their resilience to emerging threats and vulnerabilities. </span></p>

<h3>Applying Zero Trust and Defense in Depth</h3>
<hr>
<p><strong>Review the following scenario and work through the steps below.</strong></p>
<h4>Scenario</h4>
<p><em>You and your team are responsible for developing standard operating procedures for implementing both Zero Trust and Defense in Depth best practices. Select the correct option at each phase of the implementation process based on what you learned about Zero Trust and Defense in Depth in this lesson and your knowledge of cyber security.&nbsp;</em></p>

<h3>Phase 1: Access Controls</h3>
<p>Your first task is implementing access controls to enhance security. You start by evaluating user access privileges.</p>
<p><em><strong>Question 1: What should you do to ensure strict access controls?</strong></em></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
<li>Grant every user full administrative privileges to expedite their tasks.</li>
<li>Implement the principle of least privilege and grant users only the necessary access.</li>
<li>Provide all users with access to all systems and resources.</li>
</ol>
<details style="margin-bottom: 2.5rem;">
